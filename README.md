# Verdaccio Clustering


## WARNING!

This module is a work in progress. It is intended to simultaneously do these things:

1. expose start, complete, and error events for all major plugin interfaces
2. enable clustering with each node cluster potentially able to use a different persistence layer
3. enable authentication to take advantage of storage clustering

It's also exploring ways to simplify the storage plugin interface and generally exploring how verdaccio plugins work.
